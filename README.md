## Introduction

Nessus is a widely used network vulnerability scanning tool designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.
It plays a crucial role in network security assessments and helps organizations detect and mitigate risks proactively.

The primary function of Nessus is to scan networks for vulnerabilities by actively probing the target systems. 
It conducts comprehensive security assessments by examining various aspects such as operating systems, applications, services, and configurations.
Nessus employs a vast database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to compare against the target systems, providing a detailed report of potential weaknesses.

## The importance of Nessus lies in its ability to enhance network security in several ways:

1. Vulnerability Detection: Nessus detects vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers,
including software bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords, and outdated software versions.
Identifying these weaknesses allows organizations to take corrective actions before they are exploited.

2. Risk Assessment: By scanning networks, Nessus provides an accurate assessment of the security posture, helping organizations prioritize remediation efforts.
It assigns severity ratings to vulnerabilities, allowing administrators to focus on the most critical issues.

3. Compliance Auditing: Many industries have regulatory requirements regarding network security.
 Nessus helps organizations meet these compliance standards by scanning for vulnerabilities that violate specific regulations or best practices.

4. Penetration Testing: Nessus can also be used as part of a penetration testing process to simulate real-world attacks and evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures.
It helps uncover potential entry points and weaknesses in the network's defenses.

5. Continuous Monitoring: Network security is an ongoing process, and Nessus supports continuous monitoring by performing regular scans.
 This ensures that newly discovered vulnerabilities or changes in the network environment are promptly identified and addressed.
## Vulnerability

A vulnerability refers to a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or network that can be exploited by attackers. 
It represents a potential entry point through which an attacker can gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, 
or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.

## Step 2 install ubuntu on VirtualBox

- install virtual box and install to windows machine https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/UNH4M7L.png)
- download ubuntu iso image https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.6/?_ga=2.51984875.3593162.1687373027-651859050.1687373027
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/eyuOc1G.png)
- open virtual box and click new
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/nrdT3ru.png)
- name virtual machine ubuntu or whatever you want to call it , check the skip unattended installation and click next
    ![vb](https://imgur.com/LHw53K9.png)
- you can leave hardware as it is or make changes as you wish
    ![vb](https://imgur.com/owq78xD.png)
- click on install
    ![vb](https://imgur.com/1VTClPU.png)
- create a username and login information for ubuntu
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/vA2sFZn.png)
- when ubuntu is done installing go to all apps and click on terminal
    ![vb](https://imgur.com/c1pQDOl.png)
- we are going to download ssh openserver in ubuntu : that way we can remotely have access to our nessus server
  to do that we use the command " SUDO APT INSTALL OPENSSH-SERVER" enter password for your ubuntu 
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/ph9st32.png)
- click yes to continue
- now we will enable SSH after installing it , to do that: we will use the command " SUDO SYSTEMCTL ENABLE SSH"
   ![vb](https://imgur.com/Lohkb2Q.png)
- now we ll allow SSH just incase our firewall is blocking it , we use the command " SUDO UFW ALLOW SSH"
  ![vb](https://imgur.com/URfJRA4.png)
- before we continue lets go back and to our virtual box and change the network settings from NAT to Bridged adapter

- Great job for coming this far (*_^) lets gooo!!!! okay back to business, now we will SSH into our machine to test if we have a connection
- first go to powershell on windows machine
- then enter "ssh @PCname followed by IP address for the linux machine
- if you have a succesful connection it will see you have access into the linux machine.

- after successful ssh you can now go to Nessus web applicationa nd lets have some fun testing our network
- click on Create New Scan
   ![vb](https://imgur.com/zO7TDmj.png)
- click on Basic Network Scan
   ![vb](https://imgur.com/8LATdLa.png)
- we will do a non credential scan (simply put a light scan)
- name it non credential scan
- and use the IP Address for the linux machine as target
- and finally save
